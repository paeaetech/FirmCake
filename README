FirmCake - Firmware for makerbot gen 3 compatible electronics
=============================================================

Actually, current code mostly focuses on Arduino Mega electronics which is being developed by me, but I try to keep things 
easily portable to current gen3 hw.

Hardware designs will be released when the prototype is ready.
