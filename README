FirmCake - Firmware for makerbot gen 3 compatible electronics
=============================================================

Actually, current code mostly focuses on Arduino Mega electronics which is being developed by me, 
but I try to keep things easily portable to current gen3 hw.

Hardware designs will be released when the prototype is ready.


(planned) FEATURES
==================

* 100% protocol compatible with original gen3 firmware
* supports both GCode and S3G formats
* SDCard supports fat12/16/32
